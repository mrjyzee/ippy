# Image Processing using Python (ippy)
This is a collaborative effort to add new image processing algorithms to Python

What are we trying to solve?
----------------------------
There are numerous image processing algorithms for image filtering, segmentation, registration, inpainting etc.  Python and its libraries such as scipy, mahotas etc. support a number of them. However, there are many more algorithms that needs implemented in Python.

How are we solving?
-------------------
We are aiming to solve this problem by organizing hackathons. In these hackathons, we will create groups of 5-6 people.  Each group will work work on one or more algorithms depending on the complexity of the algorithm. The group will convert a known algorithm from its Java implementation in ImageJ (https://github.com/imagej/imagej1 and http://rsb.info.nih.gov/ij/plugins/). ImageJ is an open-source image processing tool in which numerous algorithms are readily available both as executable and as source code.

We will provide details of the algorithms that the group needs to program and also the mechanism at the hackathon. Each group will contain atleast one person who programs numerical computing using Python, one or more who program Python and one or more Python novice. There will be image processing experts to assist with understanding the algorithm.

You do not have to be a image processing expert to offer help.  You just need to be passionate about programming using Python.  We will offer some basic training and also advise from experts in recreating these algorithms in Python.

If you cannot come to one of our hackathon, you can still contribute to this by checking out the code, adding a new algorithm and creating a pull request to merge.
